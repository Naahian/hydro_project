## Overview  
This project aims to **simplify farming in urban and tight spaces** by automating a **hydroponic vertical farming system** with **four tower pipes**. It optimizes resource usage by **automating nutrient dosing, pH balancing, temperature control, and real-time monitoring**, ensuring a **sustainable and efficient farming system**. The system also helps **reduce water and energy waste** while maintaining ideal growing conditions, making urban farming more accessible and manageable.  

## Features  
- **Automated Nutrient & pH Dosing** – Ensures optimal EC & pH levels.  
- **Real-time Monitoring** – Tracks **temperature, pH, EC, and power consumption**.  
- **Web Dashboard** – A **Bootstrap 5-based** UI for live sensor data & historical insights.  
- **Bluetooth & WiFi Connectivity** – For remote control & monitoring.  
- **State Management** – Tracks the plant's **growth stage** *(Seed → Growth → Fruit)*.  
- **Energy Efficiency Monitoring** – Logs **current consumption per hour**.  
- **Action Logging** – Keeps a **history of watering, dosing, and sensing actions**.  


## Connectivity & Communication  
- **Bluetooth** – Used for local communication with the mobile app.  
- **WiFi (ESP32)** – Sends data to the **web dashboard**.  
- **MQTT Support** *(Planned)* – For cloud integration.  


## Future Enhancements  
- **Machine Learning-based growth optimization(Planned)** 🌿  
- **Mobile App Integration (Planned)** 📱  
- **Cloud-based Data Logging(Planned)** ☁️
